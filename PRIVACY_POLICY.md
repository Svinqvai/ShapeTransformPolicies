## ShapeTransform: Privacy policy

Welcome to the ShapeTransform app for Android!

Being an Android user, I prioritize privacy greatly.
I understand the frustration caused by apps gathering data without your awareness.

### Data collected by the app
The application does not collect any data.

### Explanation of permissions requested in the app
The list of permissions required by the app can be found in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file: are

<br/>

| Permission | Why it is required |
| :---: | --- |
| `android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` | This permission is required to read database backup if saved locally on your device. We do not access or collect any personal information stored on your device's external storage |
| `android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` | This permission is required to save dabasebackup. We do not access or collect any personal information stored on your device's external storage |
| `android.permission.VIBRATE` | Required to vibrate the device when the alarm rings. The system automatically grants permission; can't be revoked by the user. |
| `android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED` | When your device restarts, all alarms set in the system are lost. This permission enables the app to receive a message from the system once the system has rebooted and you have unlocked your device for the first time. When this message is received, the app creates a service to set all the active alarms in the system.|
