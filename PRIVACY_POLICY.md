## ShapeTransform: Privacy policy

Welcome to the ShapeTransform app for Android!


As an Android user, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how frustrating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

### Data collected by the app
The application does not collect any data.

### Explanation of permissions requested in the app
The list of permissions required by the app can be found in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file: are

<br/>

| Permission | Why it is required |
| :---: | --- |
| `android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` | Required by GoogleFit API  |
| `android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`   | Required by GoogleFit API |
| `android.permission.INTERNET`               | Required to access Google API for accessing GoogleFit data. We do NOT collect any non-personal information, such as device information, IP addresses, and usage statistics |
| `android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` | This permission is required to save certain data locally on your device, such as user preferences, and app settings. We do not access or collect any personal information stored on your device's external storage |
| `android.permission.VIBRATE` | Required to vibrate the device when the alarm is ringing. Permission is automatically granted by the system; can't be revoked by the user. |
| `android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED` | When your device restarts, all alarms set in the system are lost. This permission enables the app to receive a message from the system once the system has rebooted and you have unlocked your device for the first time. When this message is received, the app creates a service to set all the active alarms in the system.|
